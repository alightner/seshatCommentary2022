# Data and code repo for *Coding, causality, and statistical craft: The emergence and evolutionary drivers of moralistic supernatural punishment remain unresolved*

This repo accompanies our commentary, written by Purzycki, Bendixen, and Lightner (2022), on the Turchin et al. (2022) target article in *Religion, Brain, and Behavior*. It is structured into three sections, critiquing (1) their coding decisions in the dataset, (2) their statistical analyses, and (3) their post-hoc causal inferences. Our pooled script, `pooled_script.R`, includes all 3 sections, and can be run to generate all plots in the commentary and the output from our analyses. The `data/`folder includes all raw data objects that were originally uploaded by Turchin et al. at [seshatdatabank.info/datasets/moralizing-gods-dataset/](http://seshatdatabank.info/datasets/moralizing-gods-dataset/).
